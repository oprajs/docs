# Mixin Types

## Mixin Types in Opra
Mixin types are utilized within the Opra database system to consolidate two different complex data structures. These types enable the amalgamation of diverse data structures, allowing various data attributes to be merged into a single entity. Mixin types are particularly employed when there is a need to unify disparate complex data structures under a single type, enhancing the consistency and accessibility of data within the modeling process.

### Introduction
Mixin types are intrinsic to the Opra database system, addressing the requirement to combine different complex data structures. By merging distinct data structures, these types offer flexibility in consolidating separately managed data structures under a single entity.

### Application
For instance, a mixin type could combine different data structures containing a user's profile information and payment history. This facilitates the consistent and accessible management of user data, rendering the data model more meaningful and user-friendly.

Similarly, within an e-commerce platform, different data structures containing product specifications and inventory status could be consolidated under a mixin type. This enhances product management efficiency and provides customers with a more comprehensive product experience.

### Conclusion
Mixin types serve as a robust tool within the Opra database system for consolidating and managing diverse complex data structures. These types enhance the consistency and accessibility of data structures within the modeling process, enabling data to be represented in a more meaningful and user-friendly manner.
