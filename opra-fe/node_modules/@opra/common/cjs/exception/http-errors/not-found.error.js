 * 404 Not Found
 * The server can not find the requested resource. In the browser, this means the URL is not recognized.
 * In an API, this can also mean that the endpoint is valid but the resource itself does not exist.
 * Servers may also send this response instead of 403 Forbidden to hide the existence of a resource
 * from an unauthorized client. This response code is probably the most well known due to its
 * frequent occurrence on the web.
